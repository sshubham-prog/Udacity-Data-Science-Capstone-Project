### Project Motivation
It is the Starbuck's Capstone Challenge of the Data Scientist Nanodegree in Udacity. We get the dataset from the program that creates the data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers. We want to make a recommendation engine that recommends Starbucks which offer should be sent to a particular customer.The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts how will the customer respond will to an offer.

### Dataset Used
The data is contained in three files:

- portfolio.json - This contains offer ids and metadata about each offer (duration, type, etc.). The portfolio dataset has 10 rows which
correspond to an offer

- profile.json - This contains demographic data for each customer. The profile dataset has 17000 rows, each corresponding to a user

- transcript.json - This contains records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed. The transcript dataset has 306534 rows, each corresponding to an event
